# colourSearch-
I did this term frequency/ inverse document frequecy [ tf/idf ] based "search engine" for a colour csv i got on kaggle.
you are prompted to enter a colour then the programme returns a list of colours ranked by relevancy to the query colour.
As I learn more about tf/idf i will continue to post repos
